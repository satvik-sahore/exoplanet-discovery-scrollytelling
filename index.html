                <h2>The Era of Kepler</h2>
                <p>The Kepler space telescope, launched on March 6, 2009, combined advanced stellar brightness measurement techniques with the largest digital camera ever designed for space observation at the time. It was initially positioned to continuously observe 150,000 stars within a star-rich region of the Cygnus constellation, conducting the first comprehensive survey of planets in our galaxy. This mission marked NASA's first effort to identify Earth-sized planets located in the habitable zones of their stars.</p>
                <p>Kepler detected planets by observing transits—small dips in a star's brightness caused when a planet passes in front of it.</p>
                <p>The spacecraft was essentially built around a single, specially designed instrument: a telescope with a 3-foot (1-meter) aperture and an image sensor array. Its 4-foot, 7-inch (1.4-meter) mirror was one of the largest ever sent beyond Earth's orbit.</p>
                <p>Designed to monitor approximately 100,000 main-sequence stars over three and a half years, Kepler quickly demonstrated its capability by discovering five exoplanets—Kepler 4b, 5b, 6b, 7b, and 8b—within its first six weeks of operation, an achievement announced by NASA in January 2010.</p>

                <h2>How to Use the Visualization</h2>
                <h3>Interacting with the Custom Lollipop Chart</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                    <strong>Select a Parameter:</strong>
                    Use the dropdown menu to select a parameter of interest (e.g., Mass, Distance, etc.). The chart updates to show planets arranged and scaled according to the chosen parameter.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <strong>Hover for Details:</strong>
                    Hover over a planet image to view its name and value for the selected parameter in a tooltip.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <strong>Click for In-Depth Analysis:</strong>
                    Clicking on a planet generates a spider plot for a detailed comparison with Earth.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Exploring the Spider Plot</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                    <strong>Attribute Comparison:</strong>
                    Observe how the selected planet differs from Earth across attributes like Age, Mass, and Flux. Each axis shows the relative scale of the attributes, with Earth's data serving as a benchmark.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <strong>Hover for Data Points:</strong>
                    Explore the radar chart points to understand the planet's magnitude for each attribute.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Purpose of the Visualization</h2>
                <p>
                    This visualization is designed to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    <strong>Compare Habitability:</strong>
                    The lollipop chart and spider plot allow users to identify planets that are most similar to Earth and explore the reasons for these similarities. The Earth Similarity Index (ESI) is particularly insightful for this purpose.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <strong>Identify Trends:</strong>
                    The lollipop chart helps users explore trends across all habitable planets for various parameters, such as identifying planets close to Earth or those with larger radii.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <strong>Multi-Dimensional Analysis:</strong>
                    The radar chart provides a quick and intuitive way to compare planets across multiple attributes simultaneously.
